# Introduction 

A 3D Portfolio website that showcases my skills and works as a web developer.It uses 3D graphics and animation to create a visually appealing and interactive experience.

 # Features
 
- The website uses 3D graphics and animation to create a visually appealing and interactive experience.
  
- The user can interact with the 3D objects on the page, such as rotating them, zooming in and out, and moving them around.

- The website is responsive, so it looks good on all devices.

- The website is built using React, Tailwind, Framer Motion, and Three.js.

# Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-built styles and components for rapid development.
  
- Framer Motion: It is a library for creating animated transitions and interactions.
  
- Three.js: It is a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.


   # Contribution Guide

- Fork the repository, create a clone and make sure that you are not working on the `MAIN BRANCH' repository!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/3D_Portfolio.git
```

```bash
cd 3D_Portfolio
```

- It is not a good practice to work on the `main` branch. You can create a new branch by using this command

```bash
git checkout -b {name-of-the-branch-here}
```

- Add a stream so you can sync your clone with the original repository (get the latest updates)

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/namodynamic/3D_Portfolio.git
```

- Use this command to stay up to date with the original repository (not the fork that you made)

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

- Make your contribution too :)

- Open a Pull Request also.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
